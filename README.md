# dexplo
A data analysis library comparible to pandas

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dexplo/dexplo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dexplo/dexplo)

# Main Goals
* A minimal set of features 
* Be as explicit as possible
* There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

### Data Structures
* Only DataFrames
* No Series

### Data Types
* Only primitive types - int, float, boolean, str (unicode)
* No object data types

### Column Labels
* No hierarchical index
* Column names must be strings
* Column names must be unique
* Columns stored in a numpy array

### Row Labels
* No row labels for now
* Only a number display on the output
* Might add row labels in future

### Subset Selection
* Only one way to select data - `[ ]`
* Subset selection will be explicit and necessitate both rows and columns
* Rows will be selected only by integer location (for now)
* Columns will be selected by either label or integer location. Since columns must be strings, this will not be amibguous
* Column names cannot be duplicated
* Slice notation is also OK

### All selections and operations copy
* All selections and operations provide new copies of the data
* This will avoid any chained indexing confusion

### Development
* Must use type hints
* Must use 3.6 - fstrings
* Must have numpy


### Small feature set
* Implement as few attributes and methods as possible
* Focus on good idiomatic cookbook examples for doing more complex tasks

### Only Scalar Data Types
No complex Python data types
- [x] bool - always 8 bits, not-null
- [x] int - always 64 bits, not-null
- [x] float - always 64 bits, nulls allowed
- [x] str - A python unicode object, nulls allowed
- [ ] categorical
- [ ] datetime
- [ ] timedelta

#### Attributes to implement
- [x] size
- [x] shape
- [x] values
- [x] dtypes

May not implement any of the binary operators as methods (add, sub, mul, etc...)
